# OTServ
OTServ is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
based on the CIPSoft's Tibia.

# How does it work?
This OTServ charges are based on The Forgotten Server and OpenTibia SVN.
You have a look around in the folders and take a look at the config.lua
NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when not connecting to the CIP servers.
Then you are logged in.

# Developers
Tryller and frcento.
